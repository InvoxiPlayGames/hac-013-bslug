Switch Pro Controller (HAC-013) BrainSlug module
 by InvoxiPlayGames
(based off WUP-028 adapter BrainSlug module by Chadderz)

This repository contains a BrainSlug module to allow support for the Switch Pro
controller to arbitrary Wii games that support the GameCube controller.

TODO: Code cleanup and stability improvements.

To compile you will first need to install BrainSlug (though not necessarily
compile it).
